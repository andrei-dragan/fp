# Fundamentals of programming (using python)
## Objectives
- To know the key concepts of programming.
- To know the basic concepts of software engineering (design, implementation and maintenance of software systems).
- To gain understanding of basic software tools used in development and testing.
- To learn Python programming language, and to get used to Python programming, running, testing, and debugging programs.
- To acquire and improve their individual programming style.

## Assignments
- [Assignment 1](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/fundamentals-of-programming-assignment1) - getting used to Python programming language by solving some problem statements.
- [Assignment 2](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/fundamentals-of-programming-assignment2) - implement a **menu-driven console application** that works with complex numbers.
- [Assignment 3](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/fundamentals-of-programming-assignment3) - implement a command-based console application to administrate the apartments in a building, using **procedural and modular programming**, **input validation**, **specifications** and **tests**.
- [Assignment 4](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/fundamentals-of-programming-assignment4) - implement an application that works with complex numbers, **using feature-driven development** and **unit tests**.  
- [Assignment 5](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/fundamentals-of-programming-assignment5) - implement a CRUD application that manages the students' situation of a university, using **classes**, **feature-driven development**, **PyUnit test cases**, **custom exceptions**, **persistent storage using file-based repositories**.
- [Assignment 6](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/fundamentals-of-programming-assignment6) - implement an **iterable data structure**, together with sorting and filtering methods, that can be **reusable** in other projects.
- [Assignment 7](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/fundamentals-of-programming-assignment7) - implement a game similar with Battleship, using **object oriented programming**, **layered architecture**, **graphical-user interface**, together with some basic **computer AI**, the player can play against.

## Exam
- [Exam](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/exam) - implement a console-based version of the Hammurabi game (*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamurabi_(video_game)*).
